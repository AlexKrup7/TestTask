### Task 1 :
````
Implement a function with two arguments, both are lists of possibly different length.
The function must return a dictionary (dict for Python or object for JS) with keys from the first list
and corresponding values from the second. If a key lacks value,the resulting dictionary must contain
None for that key (or null for JavaScript). Redundant values must be ignored. Keys are guaranteed to be unique.

### Task 2 :
````
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 3 and 4, the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci-like sequence will be: 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, ... .
By considering the terms in this sequence whose values do not exceed seven million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
